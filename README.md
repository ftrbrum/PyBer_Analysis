# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview:

PyBer, a ride-sharing App, has requested a summary Data Frame of their ride-sharing data by city type.  As well as a line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban).


## Resources:

Data Source: [ride_data.csv](Resouces/ride_data.csv), [city_data.csv](Resouces/city_data.csv), [PyBer_ride_data.csv](Resouces/PyBer_ride_data.csv)
 
Software: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda 4.10.1, Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.56.0
 
Code: [PyBer_Challenge.ipynb](PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

Images: [analysis](analysis)

### Weekly Fares Summary

## Summary:

From the new data frame we created and analyized it is easy to see a breakdown in performances in city types over the requested categories.

Rural cities have the lowest amount of rides and drivers, which equates to the lowest amount of revenue in fares but it does amount to the largest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.  This is probably because of population size versus the length of the trip.

Urban cities have the largest amount of rides and drivers with the highest amount of revenue generated in fares.  Urban cities also have the lowest average fares per ride and average fares per driver.  This could be because there are more drivers competeing for fares with other companies and shorter distances travelled per ride.

Suburban cities fall in the middle of each category measured.
